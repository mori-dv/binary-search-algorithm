# search-algorithm
this code is source of two kinds of search algorithms which is binary search and linear search algorithm, coded in python.
the opacity of binary search algorithm in the best case is O(1), the average case is O(LogN) that means it is O(LogN) and the worst case is O(N).
the opacity of linear search algorithm in the best case is O(1), the average case is O(N) that means it is O(N) and the worst case is O(N).
